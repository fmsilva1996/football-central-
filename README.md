</p>

A desktop web application that allows users to keep up with latest football news and results. What sets Football Central apart from other apps like it is its predictions functionality, where using an algorithm it provides users with predictions for a given match.

Check out the live app: https://www.footballcentral.xyz/

**Please Note:** The News API does not provide free access outside of localhost, therefore all news sections in the live app will be empty.

## Observations

### Room For Improvement

- The CSS could be modularized more, maybe experiment with Styled Components ðŸ’…
- Pull out helper functions and make use of useCallback to reduce load on each rerender
- Solution to cache data, rather than having to rely on paid APIs for every request

### Looking to the Future

- Adopt a mobile first design pattern in future projects
- Extensive testing (>70% Coverage) with Jest and Jasmine
- Server rendering with Next.js?
- Explore state management solutions with Redux
- Get comfortable with CSS grid and thank me later!
